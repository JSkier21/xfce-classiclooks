ABOUT
=====
ClassicLooks is a Gtk+ theme aimed at providing increased consistency across the most commonly used GUI toolkits (Gtk2/3, Qt4/5, wxWidgets2/3, OpenOffice3/4, LibreOffice6); additionally, ClassicLooks tries to be "compatible" with the default Gtk3 theme 'Adwaita' in the sense that an application GUI designed to look good on Adwaita should also look good on ClassicLooks.

ClassicLooks currently supports only the XFCE desktop (the XFCE panels and the XFWM4 window manager); support for other desktop environments and/or window managers is planned for future releases.

ClassicLooks relies upon, and/or is derived from:
- Xfce Evolution Theme (http://xfce-evolution.sourceforge.net)
- Gtk2 Murrine Engine (gtk2, wxWidgets2/3, qt4/5)
- Qt5 Style Plugins (qt5)
