  IMPORTANT
  ---------
- if you currently have the 'Xfce Evolution' theme installed on your system, then YOU MUST FIRST UNINSTALL 'Xfce Evolution' before installing 'ClassicLooks' in order to clean up your system of any/all 'Xfce Evolution'-specific tweaks: follow ALL THE STEPS described in the 'UNINSTALL' section in file 'Xfce Evolution/TOOLS/SETUP/INSTALL' if you installed 'Xfce Evolution' from an 'xce-evolution-n.n.n.zip' archive, or use your package manager's uninstall procedure if you installed 'Xfce Evolution' from your OS-specific repository
